# Brief Templates

Templates for structuring marketing briefs across different formats and complexity levels.

## When to Use Which Template

| Template | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| [Campaign brief](./references/campaign-brief.md) | Full campaigns spanning multiple assets or channels |
| [Content brief](./references/content-brief.md) | Blog posts, articles, newsletters, or long-form content |
| [Ad brief](./references/ad-brief.md) | Paid ads on Google, Meta, LinkedIn, or other platforms |
| [Email brief](./references/email-brief.md) | Single email campaigns or automation sequences |

## Detail Levels

Choose the right level of detail for the campaign:

### MINIMAL
**Best for:** One-off content pieces, simple ads, internal emails

Include only:
- Target audience (specific person)
- Core message (one sentence)
- Call to action (specific action + destination)
- Success metric

### STANDARD
**Best for:** Most campaigns, team collaboration, recurring formats

Includes everything in MINIMAL plus:
- Campaign objective (SMART)
- Supporting proof points
- Tone/voice description
- Channel and format specs
- Timeline

### COMPREHENSIVE
**Best for:** Product launches, major campaigns, external agencies

Includes everything in STANDARD plus:
- Competitive context
- Messaging hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Channel-specific guidance
- Asset list with specs
- Measurement plan
- Budget context

## Brief Quality Checklist

Before production begins, verify:

- [ ] Audience is specific enough to write for (a person, not a demographic)
- [ ] Core message is singular — not two or three things
- [ ] CTA specifies the action AND the destination
- [ ] Success metric is measurable
- [ ] Proof points are factual (not claims we can't back up)
- [ ] Tone is described clearly — ideally with a reference brand or three adjectives

## The One-Message Rule

A brief should have one core message. If the brief asks copy to communicate multiple things, it will communicate none of them well. Choose the primary message and move secondary points to proof points.
