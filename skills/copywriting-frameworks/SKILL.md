# Copywriting Frameworks

Structural frameworks for persuasive marketing copy. Each framework is a different way to organize the same ingredients: your audience's problem, your solution, and the action you want them to take.

## Framework Decision Guide

| Asset type | Best framework |
|-----------|----------------|
| Email body, blog post | PAS or AIDA |
| Product page, landing page | AIDA or StoryBrand |
| Ad copy, social post | FAB or PAS (short form) |
| Homepage, positioning | StoryBrand |
| Feature announcement | FAB or AIDA |
| Re-engagement email | PAS |

## The Four Core Frameworks

### AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action

Classic direct-response structure. Works for almost any asset.

**See:** [aida.md](./references/aida.md)

**When to use:** Ads, emails, landing pages, sales pages
**Avoid when:** The reader already knows the problem — skip straight to Interest or Desire

Quick structure:
1. **Attention** — Stop the scroll or open the email
2. **Interest** — Keep them reading with relevant information
3. **Desire** — Make them want what you're offering
4. **Action** — Ask for the specific thing you want them to do

### PAS — Problem, Agitation, Solution

The most reliable framework for conversion copy. Works best when the reader has a real, felt pain.

**See:** [pas.md](./references/pas.md)

**When to use:** Email body, sales pages, ad copy, re-engagement
**Avoid when:** The reader doesn't know they have a problem (use AIDA instead)

Quick structure:
1. **Problem** — Name the pain clearly and specifically
2. **Agitation** — Rub the wound. Make them feel the cost of not solving it.
3. **Solution** — Present your offer as the specific fix

---

### FAB — Features, Advantages, Benefits

The "so what?" chain. Prevents feature-dumping by forcing the writer to connect features to outcomes.

**See:** [fab.md](./references/fab.md)

**When to use:** Product announcements, feature emails, comparison ads
**Avoid when:** The reader doesn't care about the feature details — use benefit-led framing instead

Quick structure:
1. **Feature** — What the product has or does
2. **Advantage** — Why that's better than the alternative
3. **Benefit** — What it means for the customer's life or work

---

### StoryBrand — The 7-Element Narrative Framework

A complete positioning and messaging framework, not just copy structure. Positions the customer as the hero and the brand as the guide.

**See:** [storybrand.md](./references/storybrand.md)

**When to use:** Homepage messaging, brand positioning, content marketing strategy
**Avoid when:** Writing a quick ad or email — it's a framework for messaging architecture, not individual assets

Quick structure:
1. A character (your customer) wants something
2. They encounter a problem (external, internal, philosophical)
3. They meet a guide (your brand) who has a plan
4. The guide calls them to action
5. That helps them avoid failure
6. And achieve success

## Choosing Between Frameworks

**The reader knows the problem** → Start at Interest (AIDA) or Problem (PAS)
**The reader doesn't know the problem** → Start at Attention (AIDA) with the curiosity hook
**You have specific features to announce** → FAB, then close with PAS or AIDA
**You're rewriting positioning** → StoryBrand first, then use AIDA/PAS for copy

## The Benefit Ladder

Regardless of framework, benefits must be concrete and personal. Use the benefit ladder to get there:

**Feature** → "Our tool has automated reporting"
**Advantage** → "So you don't have to manually pull data"
**Functional benefit** → "Which means your weekly report takes 10 minutes instead of 3 hours"
**Emotional benefit** → "And you can actually spend Friday afternoon on strategy instead of spreadsheets"

The further down the ladder, the more compelling the copy.
