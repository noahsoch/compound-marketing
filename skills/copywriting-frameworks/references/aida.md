# AIDA: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action

The original direct-response framework, dating to 1898. Still works because it maps to how readers actually process persuasive content.

## The Four Stages

### Attention
Stop the reader mid-scroll or make them open the email. You have 2-3 seconds.

**What works:**
- Bold claim: "We reduced churn by 40% in 90 days"
- Specific curiosity gap: "The subject line formula that doubled our open rate"
- Provocative question: "Why do most email campaigns fail in the first 3 words?"
- Unexpected statistic: "83% of SaaS teams report analytics their biggest bottleneck"

**What doesn't:**
- Generic headlines ("Introducing our new feature")
- Vague benefits ("Save time and money")
- Your company name as the headline

### Interest
Keep them reading by delivering on the Attention promise. The reader is asking: "Is this for me?"

**What works:**
- Confirm they're in the right place: "If you manage a marketing team of 5+..."
- Expand on the claim with context: "Here's what we found after analyzing 2,000 campaigns..."
- Share something they didn't know: A counter-intuitive insight or data point

**Transition signals:** "Here's why that matters..." / "The reason most teams miss this is..."

### Desire
Make them want what you're offering. The reader is asking: "Do I want this?"

**What works:**
- Paint the after-state: "Imagine closing your laptop on Friday with your weekly report done"
- Specific proof: Customer quote + metric ("Teams using this cut reporting time by 73%")
- Side-by-side comparison: The old way vs. the new way
- Social proof from their peer group: "312 marketing managers switched in Q4"

**Avoid:**
- Feature lists without benefits
- Unsubstantiated superlatives ("the best", "world-class")
- Generic testimonials without specifics

### Action
Ask for the one specific thing you want them to do. The reader is asking: "Is this worth it?"

**What works:**
- Specific CTA text: "Start your free trial" not "Click here"
- Reduce friction: "No credit card required" / "Takes 2 minutes"
- Urgency when real: "Offer ends Friday" — only use if actually true
- Restate the benefit: "Get your first automated report →"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Weak Attention hook | Lead with a specific result, not a feature |
| Too long in Interest | Confirm relevance fast, then move to Desire |
| Features in Desire | Paint the after-state, not the product specs |
| Vague CTA | Name the specific action and what happens next |

## Email Application

```
Subject: [Attention hook]
Preheader: [Expand on hook — create curiosity]

[Opening line — delivers on subject line promise] ← Interest
[1-2 sentences of context — who this is for]

[The meat — why they should care] ← Desire
[Proof point or specific outcome]
[After-state description]

[CTA — specific action and button text] ← Action
```

## Ad Application (Short Form)

Google/Meta with limited characters forces prioritization:
- Headline → Attention
- Description → Interest + Desire compressed
- CTA button → Action

Focus Attention and CTA energy — they're what readers see first and last.
