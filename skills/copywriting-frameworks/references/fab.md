# FAB: Features, Advantages, Benefits

FAB solves the most common copywriting failure: feature-dumping. It forces the writer to answer "so what?" at every step, connecting product capabilities to customer outcomes.

## The Chain

**Feature** → "What the product has or does"
**Advantage** → "Why that's better than the alternative"
**Benefit** → "What it means for the customer's life or work"

## How to Apply

For each feature, run it through the chain until you reach something the customer actually cares about:

| Feature | Advantage | Benefit |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Real-time data sync | Updates every minute instead of daily | You can make decisions today based on today's data |
| One-click report export | No formatting or copy-paste | Your weekly report takes 10 minutes, not 3 hours |
| Automated anomaly detection | Catches drops before you notice them | You stop churn before customers have already left |
| SSO integration | No new passwords to manage | IT approves it in a day instead of a quarter |

## The Benefit Ladder

Benefits exist on a spectrum from functional to emotional. The further down the ladder, the more powerful the copy:

```
Feature: "Automated reporting"
         ↓
Functional benefit: "Your report is ready every Monday morning"
         ↓
Time benefit: "Saves 3 hours per week"
         ↓
Career benefit: "More time for strategy, less time on spreadsheets"
         ↓
Emotional benefit: "You stop feeling behind and start feeling in control"
```

**Where to stop:** The right level depends on the audience and context. B2B buyers often respond well to functional and time benefits. Consumer audiences and emotional copy benefit from the deeper rungs.

## Advantage vs. Benefit: The Distinction

This is where writers get confused.

**Advantage** compares to the alternative: "Unlike CSV exports, this updates automatically"
**Benefit** is personal to the customer: "You never have to think about it"

Advantages are useful when competing with a specific alternative. Benefits are useful always.

## FAB for Product Announcements

FAB is the natural framework for feature emails and product announcements, because you're starting with something specific (the feature). Structure:

1. Open with the feature or the problem it solves (Attention hook)
2. State the advantage over what they're doing now
3. Go deep on the benefit — paint the after-state
4. CTA to try or see it

**Example:**

> **Introducing: Scheduled Reports** ← Feature named
>
> Until now, getting your weekly report meant pulling it manually — or hoping someone remembered to send it. ← Problem/Advantage frame
>
> Now, set your dashboard to export automatically every Monday at 8am. ← Feature restated
>
> Your team shows up to Monday's meeting with the same data, already reviewed. ← Functional benefit
> No more "let me pull that real quick." ← Emotional/friction benefit
>
> [Set up your first scheduled report →] ← CTA

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Stopping at Feature ("We have automated reporting") | Always complete the chain to Benefit |
| Stopping at Advantage ("Better than CSV exports") | Get personal — what does the customer gain? |
| Multiple FAB chains in one sentence | One chain per paragraph |
| Generic benefits ("saves time") | Make it specific: "saves 3 hours on Monday morning" |
