# PAS: Problem, Agitation, Solution

The most reliable framework for conversion copy. Dan Kennedy described PAS as "the most reliable sales formula in existence." It works because it meets the reader where they already are — in their pain.

## The Three Stages

### Problem
Name the pain clearly and specifically. The reader should feel recognized.

**What works:**
- Name the specific symptom: "Every Monday morning, you pull the same spreadsheet and spend 3 hours doing the same thing"
- Use their language, not marketing language: "Your data is three days old by the time it's useful" not "suboptimal reporting latency"
- Be precise: "Churn spikes in month 4 for SaaS teams" not "customers leave"

**The test:** If your audience read this line, would they say "yes, exactly"?

### Agitation
Rub the wound. Make them feel the full cost of not solving this problem. This is where many writers stop too early — they name the problem but don't dwell in it long enough to create urgency.

**What agitation does:**
- Creates emotional urgency (not just intellectual recognition)
- Connects the surface problem to the deeper fear or cost
- Makes the status quo feel untenable

**Agitation layers:**
1. **Immediate cost:** "That's 12 hours a month you'll never get back"
2. **Career/business cost:** "While competitors with automated dashboards are making decisions you're still pulling data for"
3. **Emotional cost:** "And every time your boss asks for a quick update, you have to say 'give me a couple hours'"

**Agitation techniques:**
- **The snowball:** Show how the problem compounds: "It starts with the report. Then the report drives a decision. The decision is delayed. The campaign launches late."
- **Future pacing:** "Imagine six months from now, still spending every Monday the same way"
- **Opportunity cost:** "Every day this isn't solved is a day your team is reactive instead of strategic"

**How deep to go:** As deep as it takes to make inaction feel uncomfortable. In a long-form sales page, this might be 3-4 paragraphs. In an email, 2-3 sentences. In an ad, 1 sharp line.

### Solution
Present your offer as the specific fix for the specific problem you just agitated. Don't oversell — just show it solves what you described.

**What works:**
- Direct connection back to the Problem: "That's why we built automated reporting that pulls your dashboard fresh every morning"
- Specificity: "Teams using this cut their Monday morning routine from 3 hours to 15 minutes"
- The minimum needed: Don't list every feature — just the one that directly solves the pain

**The CTA:** End with a clear, low-friction next step.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too gentle on Agitation | Spend more time in the wound before offering the solution |
| Solution too early | Don't solve the problem until the reader feels the full cost of having it |
| Generic Problem | Be so specific that the reader says "that's exactly me" |
| Solution disconnected from Problem | Mirror the problem's language in the solution |

## PAS vs. AIDA

| Use PAS when... | Use AIDA when... |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| The reader has a felt pain | The reader may not know they have a problem |
| Re-engagement (churn, reactivation) | Acquisition cold traffic |
| Specific, known pain point | Building desire for something new |
| Email to existing users | Ad copy to cold audiences |
