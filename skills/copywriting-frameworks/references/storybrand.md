# StoryBrand: The 7-Element Narrative Framework

Donald Miller's StoryBrand framework is a messaging architecture tool, not just a copy technique. It aligns your entire brand story around a single insight: **customers don't buy products, they buy a better version of themselves**.

## The Core Insight

In every great story, there is:
- A **hero** who wants something
- A **villain** who gets in the way
- A **guide** who helps the hero win

Most brands position themselves as the hero. StoryBrand says this is wrong. **Your customer is the hero. Your brand is the guide.**

## The 7 Elements

### 1. A Character (Your Customer)
Define who the hero is and what they want. Be specific.

- ❌ "Marketing teams who want better analytics"
- ✅ "Marketing managers at 20-100 person SaaS companies who want to prove ROI without drowning in spreadsheets"

The more specific the character, the more they feel seen.

### 2. Has a Problem
StoryBrand identifies three layers of problem:

**External problem:** The surface-level, practical problem
> "Manually compiling weekly reports takes hours"

**Internal problem:** The emotional or psychological problem behind it
> "I feel like I'm always reacting instead of leading"

**Philosophical problem:** The "it just shouldn't be this way" problem
> "Teams shouldn't have to spend half their week on reporting just to make informed decisions"

Copy that only addresses the external problem leaves power on the table. The internal problem is often why they actually buy.

### 3. And Meets a Guide
This is your brand. The guide doesn't save the day — they give the hero what they need to save their own day.

**The guide has two qualities:**
1. **Empathy:** "We understand the problem you're facing"
2. **Authority:** "We've helped others solve it"

Evidence of authority: customer logos, testimonials, stats, certifications, years of experience.

### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan
Customers don't act without a clear path. Reduce the friction of starting.

**Two types of plans:**

**Process plan** — Steps to get started:
1. Sign up free
2. Connect your data source
3. Get your first automated report

**Agreement plan** — Principles you commit to (builds trust):
- We'll never lock you into a contract
- Your data stays yours
- You can export everything, anytime

### 5. And Calls Them to Action
There are two types of CTAs:

**Direct CTA:** "Start free trial" / "Book a demo" / "Get started"
This is the main ask.

**Transitional CTA:** "Download our guide" / "Watch the demo" / "See how it works"
For readers who aren't ready for the direct ask. Keeps them engaged.

Have both on your homepage. Use the direct CTA prominently.

### 6. That Helps Them Avoid Failure
What's at stake if the hero doesn't act? Name the cost of inaction.

This isn't about fear-mongering — it's about respecting the reader's intelligence. They're weighing the cost of change vs. the cost of staying the same.

> "Without visibility into what's working, you're making decisions based on gut feeling while competitors optimize based on data."

### 7. And Achieve Success
Paint the after-state. What does life look like once they solve the problem?

Be specific and personal:

> "Show up to every Monday meeting with the same dashboard, already reviewed. Stop saying 'I'll get that data to you by EOD.' Know before anyone asks."

Success statements should be concrete, not abstract ("drive growth" is not a success state).

## StoryBrand for a Homepage

Arrange the 7 elements on the page:

```
Hero section:       Character's desire + your CTA
Problem section:    External + internal problem
Guide section:      Empathy statement + authority signals
Plan section:       3 simple steps
CTA section:        Direct CTA (repeated)
Success section:    After-state painted
Failure section:    Cost of inaction (subtle)
CTA section:        Final CTA + transitional CTA
```

## When to Use StoryBrand

**Use it for:**
- Homepage messaging
- Brand positioning refresh
- About page
- Pitch deck narrative
- Content marketing strategy

**Don't use it for:**
- Individual email campaigns (use AIDA/PAS instead)
- Ad copy (too long a framework for short-form)
- Product announcements (use FAB instead)

StoryBrand is a strategic messaging framework. Once you've built it, use AIDA, PAS, and FAB to execute the copy at the asset level.
