# Capture Patterns: When and What to Document

## When to Capture

### Always capture:
- **A/B test winners** — Any time a variant wins with a meaningful sample (100+ opens, 50+ clicks)
- **Unexpected outperformance** — Results 20%+ above your normal benchmark
- **Audience language discoveries** — When your audience uses a phrase you didn't put in their mouths
- **Counter-intuitive findings** — When something you expected to fail, won
- **Failures** — Document `low_performance_note` entries too — they prevent repeating mistakes

### Capture with context:
- **Strong reactions** — Comments, replies, or shares that reveal what resonated
- **Sales team feedback** — "Leads keep mentioning X" is an audience insight worth capturing
- **Customer interview quotes** — Exact language from discovery calls is gold for copy

### Skip if:
- No measurable signal (sent to <20 people, never published)
- Pure speculation without supporting evidence
- Already captured in a more specific entry

## What Makes a Capture Valuable

**The test:** Would this entry save a future version of you 30 minutes of guessing?

**High-value captures have:**
1. **The actual copy** — Not a description of it. The exact words.
2. **Specificity** — Which exact audience, which exact channel, which exact time period
3. **The mechanism** — *Why* it worked, not just *that* it worked
4. **Application guidance** — When to use this again

**Low-value captures:**
- "We sent an email and it did well" (no copy, no specifics)
- "B2B audience responds to urgency" (no specific copy, too broad)
- "Subject lines should be short" (generic advice, not an insight)

## Tagging Conventions

Consistent tags make the swipe-file-researcher more accurate.

### Emotional triggers (always tag if present):
- `urgency` — Time pressure, scarcity, deadlines
- `curiosity` — Curiosity gaps, questions, "what we learned"
- `social_proof` — Numbers, customer names, case study references
- `fear_of_missing_out` — FOMO-driven copy
- `aspiration` — Outcome-focused, "imagine if" framing
- `pain_point` — Problem-first framing
- `contrarian` — Takes that challenge conventional wisdom

### Format tags:
- `listicle` — Numbered or bulleted format
- `story` — Narrative arc, before/after
- `question` — Opens with or structures around a question
- `how_to` — Instructional framing
- `data_driven` — Leads with a statistic or research finding

### Topic tags (add your own as needed):
- `pricing`, `onboarding`, `churn`, `feature_launch`, `comparison`, `objection_handling`

## The Failed Approaches Directory

`docs/insights/failed-approaches/` is as valuable as the winning directories.

**What belongs here:**
- Copy angles that consistently underperform
- Audience assumptions that turned out wrong
- Channels that didn't work for a specific offer
- Messaging that generated complaints or unsubscribes

**How to write a failure entry:**
- Be specific about what failed and why (hypothesis)
- Note the conditions — it may work in a different context
- Include what you tried instead

Failure entries prevent repeating experiments that already have answers.
