# Typography Scale Reference

Typography in marketing design has one job: make the hierarchy legible at a glance. The wrong typeface, the wrong weight, or the wrong size destroys hierarchy even when the layout is correct.

## Scale Ratios

A type scale uses a consistent multiplier between each level. Pick one ratio per design — don't mix ratios.

| Scale name | Multiplier | Best for |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Minor third | 1.200× | Dense information layouts, poster body text, data-heavy pages |
| Major third | 1.250× | Most landing pages — standard, not too compressed, not too dramatic |
| Perfect fourth | 1.333× | Hero-heavy designs, posters, single-message ads — more expressive |
| Golden ratio | 1.618× | Single-message designs with very few text elements — maximum impact |

## Base Size by Design Type

| Design type | Body base size | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Web (landing page) | 16px | Minimum for body legibility. Use 18px for long-form. |
| Digital ad | 14px | Body legibility at small display sizes |
| Print poster A4 at 300dpi | 10pt (≈14px screen equiv.) | Scale up significantly from here |
| Print poster A3 at 300dpi | 12pt (≈17px screen equiv.) | Larger format, reader is further away |

## Generated Scale Examples

### Major Third (1.25×), 16px base — Standard landing page

| Level | Size | Typical use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| xs | 12px | Fine print, legal, captions |
| sm | 16px | Body copy, descriptions |
| md | 20px | Lead paragraph, callouts |
| lg | 25px | H3, card headings |
| xl | 31px | H2, section headings |
| 2xl | 39px | H1, sub-hero headings |
| 3xl | 49px | Hero headline |

### Perfect Fourth (1.333×), 16px base — Expressive / hero-heavy

| Level | Size | Typical use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| xs | 12px | Fine print |
| sm | 16px | Body copy |
| md | 21px | Lead paragraph |
| lg | 28px | H3 |
| xl | 37px | H2 |
| 2xl | 50px | H1 |
| 3xl | 67px | Hero / poster title |

## Typeface Categories for Marketing Contexts

### Sans-serif (Neutral, Professional)
**Examples:** Inter, DM Sans, Helvetica Neue, Geist, Plus Jakarta Sans

**Audience fit:** SaaS, B2B, developer tools, productivity, tech, healthcare

**Characteristics:**
- Excellent legibility at all sizes
- Works for both headings and body
- Reads as modern and clean
- Appropriate for information-dense layouts

**Use when:** The brand needs to feel trustworthy, capable, and professional. Default choice when unsure.

---

### Serif Display (Premium, Editorial)
**Examples:** Playfair Display, Freight Display, Libre Baskerville, Georgia, Lora

**Audience fit:** DTC e-commerce, luxury goods, premium services, fashion, publishing, high-ticket B2B

**Characteristics:**
- Signals quality and editorial authority
- Strong for headlines, avoid for body below 18px (readability degrades)
- Pairs well with a sans-serif body typeface
- Feels warm and human

**Use when:** The offer is premium-positioned, or when the brand wants to communicate depth and craft.

---

### Geometric Sans (Friendly, Consumer)
**Examples:** Futura, Nunito, Circular, Poppins, Quicksand

**Audience fit:** Consumer apps, lifestyle brands, wellness, education, prosumer tools

**Characteristics:**
- Approachable and friendly
- Works well at large sizes; can feel light at small sizes
- Good for CTA buttons where you want warmth without formality
- Associated with consumer tech (Spotify, Airbnb-adjacent aesthetics)

**Use when:** The brand needs to feel accessible, approachable, and modern-without-corporate.

---

### Monospace (Technical, Distinctive)
**Examples:** Inconsolata, Fira Code, Courier, JetBrains Mono, Space Mono

**Audience fit:** Developer tools, fintech, security, data products, technical infrastructure

**Characteristics:**
- Signals technical authenticity
- Use sparingly as a brand accent — not for body copy
- Works for code snippets, version numbers, or a single headline element
- Can feel cold if overused

**Use when:** You want to signal technical credibility for a technically sophisticated audience. One element, not the whole design.

---

## Pairing Rules

**Maximum 2 typefaces** in a marketing design. Three only if a monospace accent is used for a single specific element (e.g., a version number or code snippet in a developer tool ad).

**Pair by contrast:**
- Serif heading + Sans-serif body ✓ (classic, high contrast)
- Sans-serif heading + Sans-serif body ✓ (if different enough in weight/width)
- Serif heading + Serif body ✗ (same category — no contrast)
- Two display fonts ✗ (competing for attention)

**Weight contrast:**
- Minimum two weight steps between heading and body
- H1: 700 or 800, Body: 400 ✓
- H1: 600, Body: 500 ✗ (too similar)

## Hierarchy Check

Before finalizing any type decision, verify:

- [ ] H1 is visually dominant over H2 by at least 1.25× (the minimum scale step)
- [ ] Body copy is a minimum of 16px on web, 10pt in print
- [ ] No more than 2 typefaces (or 3 if monospace accent is used for a single element)
- [ ] Heading weight is at least 2 steps heavier than body weight
- [ ] Line-height on body is at least 1.5× the font size (e.g., 16px text → 24px line-height)
- [ ] Line-height on display headings is 1.1–1.2× (tight, creates visual mass)
